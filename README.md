# Oversized

## Intro

Oversized is a simple mod for Minecraft allowing to create crafting tables of any finite rectangular size and provide
recipes for them.

Oversized is just a library â€“ it does not add any crafting tables by itself and needs another mod to add them. If you
want to add crafting tables without modding, consider using [KubeJS](https://kubejs.com/).

## Interface

The interface is based on vanilla crafting table. It has been checked that in nondegenerate conditions it seems to
produce the same interface for 3x3 crafting as vanilla. However, any *N*x*M* configuration is permitted and the only
limit is the screen size. Please note that excessive crafting grid width may impair crafting book experience.

## Compatibility

Oversized is compatible with vanilla crafting book. Currently, no compatiblity with Roughly Enough Items is present,
although most probably it will appear sooner or later.

Please note that Oversized uses the same texture as the vanilla crafting table. Thus, resource packs may cause visual
issues, however the mod will still be fully usable.
